# Medusa Payment StreamPay Node.js Dev

Creating a Stream Payment Processor for MedusaJS with Solana blockchain and web3 technology involves configuring various aspects. Below is a rough example of how you can implement the Stream**Pay** Payment Plugin with the required configurations and details. Please note that this is a simplified example, and you should consult Solana and MedusaJS documentation for a production-ready solution.

### 1. Creating a Folder and file structure for a Node.js

The folder and file structure for a Node.js package that includes the StreamPay Payment Processor for MedusaJS with Solana blockchain integration might look like the following:

```
streampay-medusajs-project/
├── config/
│   ├── streampay.js        # Configuration for StreamPay
│   ├── solana.js           # Solana network configuration
│   └── medusa.js           # MedusaJS configuration (if needed)
│
├── lib/
│   ├── streampay.js        # Stream Payment Processor (StreamPay) implementation
│   ├── merchantWallet.js   # Merchant wallet management
│   ├── fees.js             # Fee calculation functions
│   └── medusaIntegration.js # MedusaJS integration (if needed)
│
├── node_modules/            # Node.js dependencies (generated)
│
├── package.json             # Node.js project configuration and dependencies
├── package-lock.json        # Lock file for Node.js dependencies
├── README.md                # Project documentation
│
├── app.js                   # Main application entry point
├── index.js                 # Alternate entry point (if needed)
│
└── .gitignore               # Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files
```

#### Explanation of key folders and files:

- **config/**: This directory contains configuration files for StreamPay, Solana, and MedusaJS. You may need to create these configuration files based on your specific requirements.

- **lib/**: This directory houses the core logic of your StreamPay Payment Processor, including StreamPay implementation, merchant wallet management, fee calculation functions, and MedusaJS integration (if needed).

- **node_modules/**: This folder is generated automatically by Node.js and contains all project dependencies. You don't need to create it manually.

- **package.json**: This file holds your Node.js project's configuration, including dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

- **package-lock.json**: This is an automatically generated file that locks the versions of your project's dependencies to ensure consistency.

- **README.md**: A documentation file that provides information about your project, its purpose, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

- **app.js** or **index.js**: These are the main entry points for your Node.js application. You can choose either one, depending on your project structure and preferences.

- **.gitignore**: A Git configuration file that specifies which files and directories should be excluded from version control. It helps keep your repository clean by excluding unnecessary files like node_modules.

Please note that this is a basic project structure outline. Depending on the complexity of your project and your development workflow, you may need to create additional directories or files. Additionally, you should tailor the structure to your specific implementation and coding conventions.

**2. StreamPay Configuration Example:**

Then, we need to create a configuration for Strea**mPay** with Solana network settings. Ensure you have Solana's Web3 library installed.

```javascript
const solanaWeb3 = require('@solana/web3.js');

// Solana network configuration
const solanaNetwork = solanaWeb3.clusterApiUrl('devnet'); // Replace 'devnet' with your preferred Solana network (mainnet, testnet, etc.)

// StreamPay configuration
const streamPayConfig = {
  solanaNetwork,
  // Add other StreamPay configuration options here
};
```

**3. Merchant Wallet Features:**

Incorporate merchant wallet features that allow MedusaJS to interact with the Solana blockchain. You can use Solana's wallet API to create and manage merchant wallets.

```javascript
const { Keypair, Transaction, SystemProgram, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = solanaWeb3;

// Create a new merchant wallet
const createMerchantWallet = async () => {
  const merchantWallet = Keypair.generate();
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    SystemProgram.createAccount({
      fromPubkey: payerWallet.publicKey,
      newAccountPubkey: merchantWallet.publicKey,
      lamports: 10000000, // Adjust the initial balance as needed
      space: 165, // Adjust based on your data size requirements
      programId: new PublicKey('your_program_id_here'), // Your Solana program's ID
    })
  );

  // Sign and send the transaction
  await sendAndConfirmTransaction(solanaWeb3, transaction, [payerWallet, merchantWallet]);
  
  return merchantWallet;
};

// Use createMerchantWallet() to create merchant wallets as needed
```

**4. Merchant Fees and Solana Transaction Fees:**

Define how you'll calculate and handle merchant fees and Solana transaction fees. This will depend on your specific business logic and requirements.

```javascript
// Calculate and deduct merchant fees
const calculateMerchantFees = (orderTotal) => {
  const merchantFeePercentage = 2; // Example: 2% fee
  const merchantFee = (orderTotal * merchantFeePercentage) / 100;
  return merchantFee;
};

// Calculate Solana transaction fees (can vary based on network congestion)
const calculateSolanaTransactionFees = async (transaction) => {
  const { feeCalculator } = await solanaWeb3.getRecentBlockhash();
  const lamportsPerSignature = feeCalculator.lamportsPerSignature;
  const estimatedTransactionFee = lamportsPerSignature * transaction.signatures.length;

  return estimatedTransactionFee;
};

// Use calculateMerchantFees() and calculateSolanaTransactionFees() as needed
```

**5. MedusaJS Integration:**

Finally, integrate these configurations and functions into MedusaJS as a payment provider, following the MedusaJS documentation you provided as a reference. You'll need to adapt this code to fit the MedusaJS architecture and interface.

```javascript
// Example MedusaJS StreamPay Payment Provider
const StreamPayPaymentProvider = {
  async init() {
    // Initialize StreamPay with the provided configuration
    // You may also set up any event listeners or other necessary setup here
  },

  async createPaymentIntent(order) {
    // Calculate total order amount
    const orderTotal = /* Calculate the total order amount based on your MedusaJS data */;
    
    // Calculate merchant fees
    const merchantFee = calculateMerchantFees(orderTotal);

    // Calculate Solana transaction fees
    const solanaTransactionFee = await calculateSolanaTransactionFees(/* Your Solana transaction */);

    // Calculate the final amount to be charged to the customer
    const totalAmount = orderTotal + merchantFee + solanaTransactionFee;

    // Create a payment intent or transaction with StreamPay and return the necessary details
    const paymentIntent = {
      amount: totalAmount,
      // Add other payment intent details here
    };

    return paymentIntent;
  },

  // Implement other necessary payment provider methods as per MedusaJS documentation
};

// Export StreamPayPaymentProvider for MedusaJS integration
module.exports = StreamPayPaymentProvider;
```

Remember to adjust and customize the code as needed for your specific use case and adhere to best practices for handling payments and security. This example provides a high-level overview of how to create a Stream**Pay** Payment Processor with Solana blockchain integration for MedusaJS.
